## What is a Keylogger?
> Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging): Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. A keylogger can be either software or hardware.
